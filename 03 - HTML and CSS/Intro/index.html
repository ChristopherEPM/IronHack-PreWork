			<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
			<p>by @christopherpm</p>
			<p><em>This</em> is my <strong>first</strong> blog post.</p>
			<p>We don't like this.<br>
  				It inserts a lot of extra HTML that doesn't tell us anything about your content.<br>
  				Don't do it.
			</p>
			<p>This however is much better.<p>
			<p>It still requires extra HTML.</p>
			<p>This HTML however DOES tell us something about the nature of our content.</p>
			<p>Namely, that our content is a bunch of paragraphs.</p>
			<p>This is the Ironhack logo <img src="./ironhack_logo.png" alt="Ironhack Logo"></p>
